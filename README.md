# RPGame
Open word, adventure game that I making with my frends in free time.
I implemented this code from scratch based on my team requirements 
 

Action- abstract class that eneble interaction with object. Player need to be in area (Sphere Collider) and looking at target (Box Collider). Abstract method OnAction define interaction.

SO- scriptable object used for keeping data like progres varable, sounds, dialogs and items. Editor script helps fill and read data even for people out of Unity    

State- defines the state in which the player is. Currently it is used to change the cursor icon, but the class is open to expansion
